# Project Goals

Obtain data on epiphytic growth ability of different *Pseudomonas* strains to compare with their virulence in aphids.

# Protocol

*Date Updated: 2023 November 24*

**Day -3: Plating**

1.  From -80¬∞C/current plate, plate *Pseudomonas* strains/individual colonies on KB + NA (15 ùúág/mL) + NFT (50 ùúág/mL) plates.
2.  Incubate for 24-72 hours at 28¬∞C.

**Day 0: Overnights of *Pseudomonas***

1.  Pipette 10 mL of KB + NA (15 ùúág/mL) + NFT (50 ùúág/mL) media in 15 mL culture tube.
    -   *Note: Make 1 tube/pot and don‚Äôt forget a blank!*
2.  Transfer a colony of *Pseudomonas* from plate to media.
3.  Incubate in benchtop shaker at 28C overnight (\~18 hrs).

**Day 1: Spraying**

1.  Transfer overnight *Pseudomonas* culture from culture tube to falcon tube.
2.  Pellet cells by centrifuging for 10 min on max speed
3.  Discard supernatant.
4.  Add 1 mL 10mM MgCl2 buffer and resuspend/vortex.
5.  Pellet and discard supernatant again.
6.  Add \~25 mL 10mM MgCl2 buffer and resuspend/vortex.
7.  Transfer 100 ul of sample to a blank cuvette.
8.  Measure OD of bacterial resuspension (include blank!).
    -   Goal: OD = 0.2
9.  Transfer 20 mL of bacterial resuspension into autoclaved spray bottle.
    -   Clean tops using ethanol and sterile water.
10. Retrieve 14 day old plants from plant room and place in biosafety cabinet.
11. Spray \~20 mL bacterial solution onto all the leaves and all plant surfaces (stem, top, bottom) of pot until runoff (starting to drip).
12. Allow plant to dry in the biosafety cabinet.
13. Move plant to tent downstairs and note time.
14. Incubate for 72 hours in a tent at 70F and 85% humidity.

**Day 4: Sampling**

1.  Retrieve plants from plant room and place in biosafety cabinet.
2.  Sterilize cork borer and forceps using ethanol flame and place in a sterile petri dish in biosafety cabinet.
3.  Take 10 samples from all over each plant in the pot.
    -   Place all samples from a plant in a single falcon tube, 10 discs/tube.

        -   Will end with end with 3 falcon tubes and 30 samples if sampling 3 plants (1 pot).

    -   Add 10 mL of 10mM MgCl2 buffer to falcon tubes.
4.  Sonicate falcon tubes for 10 min.
5.  Vortex to dislodge epiphytic bacteria.
6.  Make serial dilutions (2 technical replicate/sample) in 96 well plate using multichannel pipette.
    -   900 uL buffer and 100 uL sample/dilution.
7.  Plate serial dilutions on KB + NA (15 ug/mL) + NFT (50 ug/mL) plates.
    -   4 plates per sample

    -   100 ul per plate
8.  Allow plates to dry then flip upside and incubate at 28C for 24 hrs.

**Day 5: Counting**

1.  Photograph plates.
2.  Count colonies on each plate and note in spreadsheet.
3.  Calculate CFU/10 mL bacterial resuspension (ie. per sample).
